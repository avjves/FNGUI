# FNGUI
GUI for viewing the Solr database of Text Reuse in Finnish Newspapers and Journals, 1771-1910.
A modified version of Blacklight, uses Ruby and Rails. Solr is used as the back-end. 

NOTE: This is not a plug-n-play installation of the search engine. This is hardwired to fit our data, so to use this with different data requires some changes.
